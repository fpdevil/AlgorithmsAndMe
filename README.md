# Algorithms And Me

Implementation of some random Algorithms in Haskell, primarily for ny own understanding and improvement of the Haskell language and Mathematics. As the time goes Î™ will include many algorithms. 

## Algorithms
* Coin Change problem (Not DP)
* FastFibonacci Sequence
* Longest Common Subsequence
* Edit Distance between the Strings
* Ugly Numbers
* To be Continued

# Haskell
```haskell
main
```

## TODO
Need to implement several other languages and cover some test cases.
